# FireTruck

### About

For this project, I was in charge of designing the electronic circuit for an autonomous firefighting robot and programming it as well. The robot could sense objects in front of it and turn if an obstacle was too close. It could also detect the presence of a fire that was close by. When a fire was sensed, the robot stopped moving and actuated a syringe filled with water using a servo motor.
